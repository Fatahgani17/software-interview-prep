        <p>What is Agile Methodology in Project Management</p>
        <p>
          Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant 
          collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage. The Agile methodology begins 
          with clients describing how the end product will be used and what problem it will solve. This clarifies the customer's
          expectations to the project team. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and 
          evaluating â€” which might just change the final deliverable to fit the customer's needs better. Continuous collaboration 
          is key, both among team members and with project stakeholders, to make fully-informed decisions.
