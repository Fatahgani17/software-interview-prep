      <p>
        What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?
      </p>
      <p>
        Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function
        calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on
        long-running taks such as a network request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop.
        When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and the
        code keeps running without blocking. When the response is ready, an
        interrupt is fired, which causes an event handler to be run, where the
        control flow continues. This way, a program thread can handle many
        concurrent operations.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        User interfaces are asynchronous by nature, and spend most of their time
        waiting for user input to interrupt the event loop and trigger event
        handlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Node is also asynchronous by default. This means that the server works
        in the same way. It waits in a loop for a network request, and accepts
        more incoming requests while the first one is being handled.
