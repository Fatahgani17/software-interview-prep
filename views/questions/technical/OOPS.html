        <p>What is OOPS?</p>
        <p>
            Object oriented design started right from the moment computers were invented. 
            Programming was there, and programming approaches came into the picture. 
            Programming is basically giving certain instructions to the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
           The OOP concept was basically designed to overcome the drawback of the above programming methodologies,
            which were not so close to real-world applications. The demand was increased,
            but still, conventional methods were used. This new approach brought a revolution 
            in the programming methodology field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is nothing but that which allows the writing of 
            programs with the help of certain classes and real-time objects. We can say that 
            this approach is very close to the real-world and its applications because the 
            state and behaviour of these classes and objects are almost the same as real-world objects.
